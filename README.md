# Data Visualization Dashboard
This program creates a visual dashboard showing the academic statistics of Calvin College seniors in 2004. Namely, 
it allows the user to view 271 students' SAT-Math (SATM), SAT-Verbal (SATV), and GPA scores near the end of their graduation. 

## Purpose
The idea behind this program is to provide a case study of college students to see if there is a correlation between
high test scores in college placement tests and high GPA scores nearing the exitation of the college. 

It is important to note, however, that the dataset given does not distinguish students from differing majors, backgrounds, or
any other characteristics. It is a straightforward comparison between testing aptitudes and academic performance.

## Getting Started
To run this program, you need to have Processing installed. It can be downloaded from this website:
https://processing.org/

Then, once installed, run any of the Processing (.pde) files in the main folder. It will open up Processing with the project
loaded into it.

Hit the "Run" button at the top, and then select the .csv file you wish to use. An example 'srsatact.csv' has been provided, but
other datasets can be used as long as it matches the formatting of the example.

## Running the Program                                                           
The vertical dimension of the bar graph and line graph can be changed by clicking on the label. Once clicked, the element viewer 
on the right will change to show four total dimensions. Click on any of these four to change that graph's dimensions.                                          

The scatterplot graph can be changed into six different configurations, each showing different dimensions. Click on any of the 
six plots in the scatterplot matrix to change the larger scatterplot.   

By clicking on any red point or hovering over any line, the element viewer will respond to show that relevant student's information.
